# font-switcher README

Font Switcher allows you to quickly switch between fonts in you settings.json configuration file.

## Features

If you are like me, you are very indescisive about your font choices.

Font Switcher allows you to quickly switch your editor's font without having to manually reorder your "editor.fontFamily" setting

Simply open the command pallete `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Switch Font`.

To get started, make sure you have a few different fonts defined in your `settings.json` file under `editor.fontFamily`

For Example:

You would have this menu:
